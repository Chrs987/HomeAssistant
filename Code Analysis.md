# Code Analysis for Software Security Engineering


## Code Review Strategy

<TODO> Insert Code Review Strategy

## Manual Code Review

<TODO> Insert Findings from manual code review of critical security functions identified in misuse cases, assurance cases, and threat models.

## Automated Tool Findings

### Bandit

#### Overview

[Bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit) is a Python based tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. To do this it will process each file, build an AST from it, and run appropriate plugins against the AST nodes. Once bandit is done scanning the files it will generate a .csv report.

<TODO> Insert metrics of findings (i.e. code scaned/metrics)
#### Key Findings

<TODO> Insert Key Findings from automated code scanning (if available). Include links to full reports. (Also check for CWEs)

## Summary of Key Findings

<TODO> Insert summary of key findings from manual and/or automated scanning. This summary should include mappings to CWEs to describe categories of major findings.

## Contributions to Open-Source Project
<NOTE>If applicable
<TODO> Planned or ongoing contributions to the upstream open-source project (documentation, design changes, code changes, communications, etc.) These can be based on any of the prior assignments in the class.
