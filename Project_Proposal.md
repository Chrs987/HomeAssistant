# Home-Assistant Project Proposal

## Operational Environment
The operational environment this project focuses on is the home environment. The software is used for personal use. 
  ### Systems Engineering View Diagram
  TODO: Provide a diagram that identifies the systems engineering view (https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/slides/lecture-1/systems-security-engineering.html#13) of the software in the hypothetical environment. 
  ### Security Needs
    - Secure Addons
      - Addons should be regularly updated and not contain malicious content.
    - Secure Communication
        Home-Assistant acts as a hub for IoT devices. 
  TODO: What are the threats perceived by users of the software in its intended operational environment? (If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your project selection.)
  ### Security Features
  TODO: Develop a list of security features in the software (Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice).

## Team motivation for selecting this project.

  - Our team has primarily been in contact over Discord and we decided to work on Home-Assistant for our OSS project. As a team, we each contributed information to the project proposal and commits can be viewed on Github in our repository [Home-Assistant](https://github.com/Chrs987/HomeAssistant/issues). We will be
