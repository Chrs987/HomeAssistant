# Home-Assistant Project Proposal

## Operational Environment
The operational environment this project focuses on is the home environment. The software is used for personal use. 
  ### Systems Engineering View Diagram
TODO: Provide a diagram that identifies the systems engineering view (https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/slides/lecture-1/systems-security-engineering.html#13) of the software in the hypothetical environment. 
  ### Security Needs
- Secure Addons
  - Addons should be regularly updated and not contain malicious content.
- Secure Communication
  - Home-Assistant acts as a hub for IoT devices. 
TODO: What are the threats perceived by users of the software in its intended operational environment? (If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your project selection.)
  ### Security Features
TODO: Develop a list of security features in the software (Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice).

## Team motivation for selecting this project.

## Open-Source Project Description of Home-Assistant 
- Home Assistant is a python based open source home automation system that allows users the ability to put local control and privacy first. It tracks the state of all the devices in the users home uniting them under a single mobile-friendly interface. Home Assistant takes control of all devices without storing any data in the cloud and lets the user set up advanced rules to control devices.

- Popularity
  - Information on how many downloads or active Home-Assistant users was unavailable, but Home-Assistant is talked about in present time on different technical magazines and journal sites such as [Linux Magazine](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2017/203/Home-Assistant), [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/home-assistant), [Linux.com](https://www.linux.com/news/home-assistant-python-approach-home-automation-video/), and [OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/article/17/7/home-automation-primer)
- Languages Used: Python (100.0%)
- Platform(s)
  - Available on different operation systems and hardware platforms. Home-Assistant is officially supported on Raspberry Pi and Docker but can be isntalled on Linux, Android, MacOS, and Windows.
