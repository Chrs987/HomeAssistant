## Summary of Observations

Overall Home Assistant was able to mitigate or mark the threats as "Not Applicable." One of the major advantages of using Home Assistant is that it is not dependent on cloud services and runs primarily on the users’ local network. This allows Home Assistant to control, communicate, and operate without having to communicate with the internet. A bulk of Home Assistants features can be controlled from the user’s local network without exposing Home Assistant to the outside world, however this does take away the effectiveness of the software. For Home Assistant to run effectively it will need to communicate with external (outside of the network) applications such as GitHub, Credstash, Cloud Services, and Remote Management. These all need to be manually enabled by the user and Home Assistant offers some [documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/securing/) on how to secure the software to prevent against the different S.T.R.I.D.E. threats. We evaluated the S.T.R.I.D.E. threats generated by [Microsoft's Threat Modeling Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49168) and presented our findings below. The findings below are the cumulative results for each threat model we created above.
